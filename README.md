# Student Performance Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains a data science project focused on analyzing and predicting student performance based on various factors. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to explore patterns in student data and develop predictive models to anticipate academic outcomes.

### Overview
This project aims to understand how various factors, including Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch, and Test preparation course, influence student performance, particularly in test scores. By analyzing these variables, we seek to uncover insights into the dynamics that shape academic outcomes and develop predictive models to anticipate student performance based on these attributes.

### Key Features
-  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigate the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and correlations among different variables.
-  Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables for machine learning models.
-  Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance predictive performance.
-  Model Building: Develop machine learning models, such as regression or classification algorithms, to predict student performance.
-  Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the predictive models using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques.
-  Visualization: Visualize key insights and model outcomes through charts, graphs, and plots.

### Dataset
The dataset includes variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch, Test preparation course, and test scores. By exploring this dataset, we aim to understand how these factors influence student performance, particularly in test scores. This dataset serves as the foundation for our analysis and model building efforts in predicting student outcomes.
